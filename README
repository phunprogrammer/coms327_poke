# COMS 327 - Assignment 06
This is assignment 06 of the Pokemon game for COMS 327. In this iteration, the `PC` can now traverse between screens. When traversing the position and data on previous screens' entities will be saved. Also, the user can fly by hitting `f` then typing in two integers between -200-200. In addition to these features all files have been converted to c++ and utilize new c++ functionality.

## KNOWN BUGS:
Using escape to backout has a slight delay. (I think this is a bug with ncurses)

## HOW TO RUN:
To run use `make` in the terminal then run the `game` executable generated from it. Use `make clean` to delete generated files.
