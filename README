# COMS 327 - Assignment 05
This is assignment 05 of the Pokemon game for COMS 327. In this iteration, when running the game, use the key pad to move the PC around, all other controls should be according to the assignment. When entering a building shift must be held down. After battling a trainer they will die leaving this world.

## KNOWN BUGS:
PC cannot initiate battles.
Using escape to backout has a slight delay. (I think this is a bug with ncurses)

## HOW TO RUN:
To run use `make` in the terminal then run the `game` executable generated from it. Use `make clean` to delete generated files.
