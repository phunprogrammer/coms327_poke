# COMS 327 - Assignment 04
This is assignment 03 of the Pokemon game for COMS 327. In this iteration, when running the game, the map will generate with a PC and a default value (10) npcs. Use `--numtrainers #` to generate any number of npcs. As the PC you can move around using `W,A,S,D`. As the PC you can also use click `enter` to skip your turn otherwise it will automatically skip your turn in three seconds. To fast-forward, hold down the `enter` key.

## KNOWN BUGS:
Wanderers behave very similarly to explorers.
Sometimes NPCs will freeze, especially the pacer.
Moving the PC will regenerate NPC paths so that can fix stuck NPCS.

## HOW TO RUN:
To run use `make` in the terminal then run the `game` executable generated from it. Use `make clean` to delete generated files.
